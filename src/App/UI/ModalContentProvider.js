          "<p>At Headstorm, I gained diverse experience managing client expectations, sprint planning, coding, meeting facilitation, conflict resolution, and training new employees across six different projects. I demonstrated expertise in React, React Native, TypeScript, JavaScript, and other modern web technologies all while adapting to different workflows such as Agile, Kanban, and Waterfall. My work included both greenfield and enterprise applications, often bridging technical gaps and collaborating with non-technical stakeholders. During my time there I wore many hats learning how to contribute to project discovery, scope estimations, leading meetings, leading teams, working at the bottom of big teams, designing demos, architecting entire frontends, and hoping in to a pre-existing codebase. </p><p></p><p>Check out my full resume below for more details.</p>",

          "<p>As a freelancer, I continue to hone my ability to independently design, architect, and implement full-stack solutions, combining technical expertise with problem-solving to meet diverse client needs. My work emphasizes creating efficient, user-friendly systems and keying in on the clientâ€™s repetitive processes to save them time. Freelancing continues to teach me how to truly work alone and fully asynchronously. When troubleshooting, designing, and implementing, I was required to adapt and learn without the minds of 60+ other engineers to lean on. This transition also forced me to learn and improve upon my time and project management skills. This was an exciting learning curve for me and it also opened up capacity for me to focus on more independent creative outlets, like this digital portfolio!</p><p></p><p>Check out my full resume below for more details.</p>",
