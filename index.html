                Unfortunately, all of my projects at Headstorm were under an
                NDA. Therefore I cannot share any code examples. However, you
                can find detailed project descriptions in my resume and a
                general description of my time there at the portal below.

                so feel free to poke around there! Since you have access to the
                full GitHub, I won't fill this space with code snippets but
                instead will tell you about the project, how I went about
                building it, and what I've learned. This app is hosted with
                Vercel and built using Vite and Javascript while also leveraging
                a key Javascript package, three.js, for the 3D rendering. The
                models were made in Blender, the avatar is from Ready Player Me,
                and the animations were done using Mixamo. I took a course on
                Zero to Mastery from Jesse Zhou to learn about three.js and
                blender fundamentals.

                The inspiration, so I had some downtime on the Ryailiti project
                and wanted to fill that time productively. I was also itching to
                work on my creative skills. Coupling those wants with my need to
                stand out in a competitive job application environment, sparked
                this idea for a creative resume/portfolio.
              </p>
              <p class="project-description-text">
                You'll notice the project is entirely in Javascript. I made this
                choice fo a few reasons. First, the course I followed started
                that way so adding in a framework or other bits to the
                architecture would have taken some decent overhauling. Second,
                I've used React and other frameworks for almost all of my
                projects so far. I wanted to challenge myself to build this
                without relying on a framework and thus learn a new way to do
                much of the same things.
              </p>
              <p class="project-description-text">
                This forced me to learn and utilize more niche Javascript
                features, Javascript classes, CSS, HTML, and lots of interaction
                with the document API. I also learned a lot about
                programmatically modifying CSS when building these modals.
                Learning how to use Blender, animations, and 3D modelling gave
                me some new insight into the joys of design.
              </p>
              <p class="project-description-text">
                Overall, this project taught me new ways of thinking, I learned
                the power of forcing limitaitons to discover new skills, and I
                gained some great in depth knowledge of Javascript outside of
                frameworks.
